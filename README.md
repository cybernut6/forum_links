# Links

Below is a list of web links to select forum posts I created on Reddit and WD community forum few years ago (in some screenshots in Reddit links my name is visible in the VNC window title). If you click on the username (Cybernut1) it will bring back too many of my forum comments, so this is just some selected posts. Someone with Linux/sysadmin skills might want to review this material.
  
  
##### Western Digital (WD) User Forum Links (my username – Cybernut1):

1.	https://community.wd.com/t/phpmyadmin-sql-database-storage-location/99422  
Helped user with technical MySQL database info (database location and security vulnerabilities).

2.	https://community.wd.com/t/ex4100-public-key-auth-over-ssh-changes-killed-on-reboot/142590/2  
Advised user how to persist config files that a system reboot wipes out.

3.	https://community.wd.com/t/sftp-possible-on-ex2/98186  
Demo of my earliest firmware hack where I shutdown WD’s locked, unconfigurable SSH server and started a configurable SSH server (required firmware compilation). This allowed use of password-free, key-based authentication and encrypted file transfers (SFTP) by non-root users.

4.	https://community.wd.com/t/enabling-logging-for-lighttpd-web-server/98350  
Guide I wrote to enable logging on built-in webserver (lighttpd) of WD NAS servers.

5.	https://community.wd.com/t/logging-shell-break-in-attempts/98410  
Guide I wrote to enable SSH logging to show how intrusion attempts were constantly being attempted on my server.

6.	https://community.wd.com/t/hacks-to-make-public-share-and-usb-shares-private/98213  
Guide I wrote to turn the public shares (directories) of the server private, because WD did not give a way for users to configure this by themselves.
  
  
##### Reddit Links (my username – Cybernut1):

1.	https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/3wtxqf/comments_on_beginners_nas_considering_wd_my_cloud/cxzn9al  
Gave a detailed comparison between WD NAS and QNAP NAS servers to a potential buyer seeking recommendations for a NAS server. Gave the forum user a small demo of me running Oracle database on my QNAP NAS server (link to pictures of my Oracle installation in this post).

2.	https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/3siadp/starting_my_home_lab_journey/cwxklhm  
Pointed another potential buyer towards the features of a QNAP NAS server including the ability to run VMs, on which I was running my Oracle database.
